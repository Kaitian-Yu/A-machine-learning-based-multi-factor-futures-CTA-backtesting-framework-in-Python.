# Machine-Learning-Based Multi-Factor Futures CTA Backtesting Framework (Python)

A complete and modular CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) research & backtesting
framework for **multi-asset, intraday futures** using machine learning, 
multi-factor modelling, and robust systematic validation.  
Designed for research accuracy, interpretability, extensibility, and production-style evaluation.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This framework implements an **end-to-end CTA research pipeline**, covering:

- **Data engineering** for multi-asset 5-minute futures data  
- **Feature & alpha factor modelling** (momentum, reversal, volatility, technical indicators, ML features)
- **Predictive diagnostics** (IC/IR, decay, quantile-return, cross-instrument robustness)
- **Interaction-based ML feature generation**
- **Production-style backtesting engine** with realistic slippage, fees, execution assumptions
- **Volatility targeting & position sizing**
- **Walk-forward validation** for realistic out-of-sample evaluation
- **Scenario-based robustness testing** (stress tests, parameter perturbations)
- **Result analysis** including performance attribution & stability evaluation

This project is designed as a research-grade toolset for quantitative futures strategies.
